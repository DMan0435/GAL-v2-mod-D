# GAL-v2-mod-D

This is a modification of Knack Tactical's GAL V2 LAM project, found here: https://github.com/knack-tactical/GAL

This version requires several different components to be built, and custom 3D printed models found here.  Read the parts list and build guide documents for information on what you need.  If you have Knack's parts kit, many of the included parts can be used in this design as well.
